# Liskov substitution principle [LSP]
"""
Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes
 without altering the correctness of that program.

If in a subclass, you redefine a function that is also present in the base class, 
the two functions ought to have the same behaviour. This, though, does not mean that 
they must be mandatorily equal, but that the user, should expect that the same `type`
of result, given the same input.

Abstractions should not depend on details. 
Details should depend on abstraction.

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.
Both should depend on abstractions
